# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-transfer-learning-and-Adversarial-Attacks
 
With  the  rapid  development  of  technology, automobiles  have  become  an  essential  asset  in  our  day-to-day lives.  One  of  the  most  important  researches  are  *Traffic  Signs Recognition  (TSR)*  systems.

This is a complete Traffic sign classification project using several deep learning models like : 
1. Simple Baseline Deep CNN,
2. Modified DCNN, 
3. LSTM, 
4. Resnet50, 
5. VGG16.

You'll find a full EDA, implementation of models, results comparsion and applied *Adversarial Attacks* to fool the model at the end.

The dataset used here is **German traffic sign from Kaggle.**\
It is a single image, multi-class classification problem with more than 40 classes and 50000 images. 
The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign).
